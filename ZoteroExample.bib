	abstract = {This best-selling classic provides a graduate-level, non-historical, modern introduction of quantum mechanical concepts. The author, J. J. Sakurai, was a renowned theorist in particle theory. This revision by Jim Napolitano retains the original material and adds topics that extend the text’s usefulness into the 21st century. The introduction of new material, and modification of existing material, appears in a way that better prepares the student for the next course in quantum field theory. You will still find such classic developments as neutron interferometer experiments, Feynman path integrals, correlation measurements, and Bell’s inequality. The style and treatment of topics is now more consistent across chapters.   The Second Edition has been updated for currency and consistency across all topics and has been checked for the right amount of mathematical rigor.},

	abstract = {We present an open source computational framework geared towards the efficient numerical investigation of open quantum systems written in the Julia programming language. Built exclusively in Julia and based on standard quantum optics notation, the toolbox offers speed comparable to low-level statically typed languages, without compromising on the accessibility and code readability found in dynamic languages. After introducing the framework, we highlight its features and showcase implementations of generic quantum models. Finally, we compare its usability and performance to two well-established and widely used numerical quantum libraries.
Program summary
Program Title: QuantumOptics.jl Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/3696r5jhm4.1 Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: Julia Supplementary material: Full list of functions (API) as html Nature of problem: Dynamics of open quantum systems Solution method: Numerically solving the Schrödinger or master equation or a Monte Carlo wave-function approach. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features: The framework may be used for problems that fulfill the necessary conditions such that they can be described by a Schrödinger or master equation. Furthermore, the aim is to efficiently and easily simulate systems of moderate size rather than pushing the limits of what is possible numerically.},

The high degree of controllability, the novel detection possibilities and the extreme physical parameter regimes that can be reached in these ‘artificial solids’ provide an exciting complementary set-up compared with natural condensed-matter systems, much in the spirit of Feynman’s vision of a quantum simulator. Here we review recent advances in technology and discuss progress in a number of areas where experimental results have already been obtained.},

By determining defining conditions for measures of coherence we identify classes of functionals that satisfy these conditions and other, at first glance natural quantities, that do not qualify as coherence measure. We conclude with an outline of the questions that remain to be answered to complete the theory of coherence as a resource.},
